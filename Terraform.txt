Setup Terraform for AWS:

* Install AWS CLI from official website.
	- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
* After going to that website choose on which platform you want to install ex: mac,windows,linux.
* execute the following commands to install.

step-2:
* we can configure AWS in two ways 1. IAM(Identify and Access Management) and 2. root user.
1. Configure through root user
* click on your user name right hand side top.
* click on "Security credentials"
* under access key click on create access key.
* put check mark for "I understand for creating root assess key"
* Now open terminal, VS-code or git bash in your local system and give command "aws configure".
* it will ask for Access key, secret Access key, default zone.

2. create an AWS IAM user:
* To interact with AWS programmatically, you should create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with appropriate permissions. Here's how to create one:
	a. Log in to the AWS Management Console with an account that has administrative privileges.
	b. Navigate to the IAM service.
	c. Click on "Users" in the left navigation pane and then click "Add user."
